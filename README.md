## Format:

- [TBD]
- The format of the AstroVibe aims to focus on "getting some work done" with the help of in-person communication and collective learning.
- We propose the following format, but the final schedule is up for discussion:
  - Start with a short, 5-min introduction of your project without any slides.
  - Proceed to work on the proposed project.
  - Casual discussion during lunch break to check in on the progress and discuss any bottlenecks or problems.
  - Another work session till the end of the day, before having a final check-in.
  - On the second day, present the outcome of each proposed project and have a final discussion.
 
## Principles: 

- **Planned Ahead**: The person who proposes the AstroVibe project should seriously intend to carry out this project and is responsible for ensuring the feasibility and readiness of the project.
- **Come Prepared**: You are responsible for learning the basics of LLM-assisted or Agent-based coding and getting familiar with the required LLM models, agent interface, and coding IDE. You should be ready to begin work on the proposed project at the start of the event.
- **Be Open**: If you are not ready to share your idea, that's Ok. But during the event, we aim to be open and encourage sharing.
